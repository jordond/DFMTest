# DFMTest

A sample app for testing on-demand Dynamic Feature Modules.  Since it is not available on Google Play yet, there is no way to test the on-demand delivery.  You can however run it from Android Studio, and test out the other functionality.

## Installation

Importing into Android Studio is a bit trickier than usual, because of a bug in the current version of Android Studio, and using kotlin DSL for gradle.

1. Clone the repo
    - `git clone https://github.com/jordond/DFMTest`
1. Open Android Studio, and close any open projects
    - The project selct dialog should open up
1. Select "Import project (Gradle Eclipse ADT, etc.)

4. Then you just need to let it Gradle Sync.
5. Run the app, you should see the following:
